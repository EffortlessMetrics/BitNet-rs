This file contains implementation notes for file locking and network retry in setup-cpp-auto.

## Summary

Implemented AC7-AC8 requirements:
1. FileLock struct with RAII pattern
2. Network retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
3. Lock acquisition in install_or_update_backend
4. Stale lock cleanup (>1 hour old)

## Key Changes

1. Added imports: Duration, Instant, SystemTime, AsRawFd (unix), AsRawHandle (windows)
2. Added FileLock struct with acquire() and Drop impl
3. Added clone_repository_with_retry() function
4. Updated install_or_update_backend() to use lock and retry
