# Unsupported Performance Claims Patterns (AC10)
#
# These patterns represent unsupported performance claims in documentation.
# All performance claims must reference receipt evidence or baseline data.

# Unsupported specific numbers (unrealistic claims)
200 tok/s
500 tok/s
1000 tok/s
50x faster
100x speedup

# Vague performance claims without evidence
blazing fast
lightning speed
ultra-fast inference
blazingly fast
extremely fast
incredibly fast
super fast
very fast performance

# Unsupported comparison claims
faster than PyTorch
faster than ONNX
faster than TensorFlow
outperforms X
beats X by Y%

# Acceptable performance claims (with evidence):
# - "10-20 tok/s (see docs/baselines/20251015-cpu.json)"
# - "Measured 15.3 tok/s on CPU (receipt in ci/inference.json)"
# - "Performance baseline: docs/baselines/"
# - "Receipt-verified throughput: X tok/s"

# Replacement Pattern:
# OLD: "BitNet-rs achieves blazing fast inference"
# NEW: "BitNet-rs achieves 10-20 tok/s on CPU for 2B models (see docs/baselines/)"

# OLD: "Ultra-fast 1000 tok/s throughput"
# NEW: "Measured 15.3 tok/s for I2_S quantization (receipt in ci/inference.json)"

# Evidence Requirements:
# - All performance numbers must reference receipt or baseline
# - Use "measured", "receipt-verified", or "baseline" terminology
# - Link to specific receipt files or baselines/ directory
