  "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrent codebase contains mocked inference paths that bypass real kernel execution. This violates honest compute principles and makes performance claims unverifiable.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Generate CPU baseline receipt with real kernel IDs\n2. Implement receipt verification in CI (Model Gates workflow)\n3. Remove all mocked inference code paths\n4. Update documentation with receipt-verified performance\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] CPU baseline generated with I2_S quantization\n- [x] Receipt schema v1.0.0 implemented\n- [x] Model Gates (CPU) workflow operational\n- [x] All mocked inference removed from production\n- [x] Documentation updated with receipt evidence\n\n## Resolution\n\nFixed in PR #435. CPU baseline established at docs/baselines/20251009-cpu.json with measured 15.3 tok/s performance.",
