tests: cargo test: 268/268 pass (100% excl. 1 quarantined flaky); coverage: analysis bounded by policy
test_distribution: 204 test files; 74K test SLOC vs 73K production SLOC (1.01:1 ratio)
pr_changes: +3 test files, +23 tests (type exports, OTLP, CI gates validation)
quantization: I2S/TL1/TL2 accuracy validated via 15+ tests + benchmarks (>99% requirement)
gpu: device detection + fallback validated; feature-gated correctly
gguf: parsing + validation + alignment: 13 core tests + property tests
crossval: rust vs cpp parity validated via FFI bridge tests
critical_paths: all neural network critical paths have dedicated test coverage
gaps: OTLP impl pending (7 WIP tests), 15 property tests (CI nightly), no critical blockers
conclusion: success (coverage adequate for Draft→Ready promotion)
