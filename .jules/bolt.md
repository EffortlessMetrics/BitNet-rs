## 2024-11-22 - HashMap Key Allocation Optimization (OBSOLETE)
**Learning:** Using `String` as a `HashMap` key when `&str` is available is inefficient. However, this task was closed as obsolete due to refactoring in PRs #608–#638.
**Action:** Always verify if ongoing refactoring affects current optimization tasks.
