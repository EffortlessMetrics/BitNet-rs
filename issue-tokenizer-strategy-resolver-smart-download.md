# [Tokenizers] Implement intelligent tokenizer strategy resolution with smart download

## Problem Description

The tokenizer strategy resolver lacks intelligent selection and smart download capabilities for optimal tokenizer configuration based on model and use case requirements.

## Environment

- **Component:** Tokenizer strategy resolution
- **Missing Feature:** Smart download and automatic strategy selection

## Proposed Solution

1. Implement intelligent tokenizer strategy selection
2. Add smart download with caching and fallbacks
3. Create compatibility detection algorithms
4. Add performance-based strategy optimization

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Design strategy resolution architecture
- [ ] Implement compatibility detection algorithms
- [ ] Add smart download with caching mechanisms
- [ ] Create performance-based selection criteria
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing across tokenizer types
