# SHA256 checksums for BitNet C++ implementation
# This file contains checksums for key files to verify integrity
#
# NOTE: Since we're using the 'main' branch of Microsoft BitNet repository,
# checksums will change with each update. For production use, consider
# pinning to a specific commit and updating checksums accordingly.

# Format: <checksum>  <filename>
# Example:
# a1b2c3d4e5f6...  src/main.cpp
# f6e5d4c3b2a1...  include/bitnet.h

# To generate checksums for the current version:
#
# cd ~/.cache/bitnet_cpp
# find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" | sort | xargs sha256sum > checksums.txt
#
# Then copy relevant checksums to this file for verification.

# Checksums for main branch (updated as needed):
# [No static checksums available - using latest main branch]
