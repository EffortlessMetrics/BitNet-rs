# SHA256 checksums for BitNet C++ implementation
# This file contains checksums for key files to verify integrity
# Update this file when updating to a new version of BitNet.cpp

# Format: <checksum>  <filename>
# Example:
# a1b2c3d4e5f6...  src/main.cpp
# f6e5d4c3b2a1...  include/bitnet.h

# Note: This file is currently empty as checksums need to be generated
# for the specific version being used. Run the following to generate:
#
# cd ~/.cache/bitnet_cpp
# find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" | sort | xargs sha256sum > checksums.txt
#
# Then copy relevant checksums to this file for verification.

# Checksums will be added here when a specific BitNet.cpp version is pinned
