# Intel 258V Hardware Artifacts

This directory holds machine-local artifacts for the Core Ultra 7 258V Lunar
Lake laptop.

Expected path pattern:

```text
ci/hardware/intel-258v/<date>/platform-probe.json
ci/hardware/intel-258v/<date>/cpu-bitnet-validation.json
ci/hardware/intel-258v/<date>/cpu-phase-benchmark.json
```

`platform-probe.json` is visibility-only. It may record CPU AVX2 facts, Arc
140V OpenCL/Level Zero/OpenVINO GPU visibility, Intel NPU OS/OpenVINO
visibility, memory, power, and OS context. It must not claim BitNet inference,
Arc 140V execution, NPU execution, or acceleration.

`cpu-phase-benchmark.json` converts strict CPU proof receipts into phase-aware
CPU evidence. It may measure only the phases present in the supplied strict
proof and must keep unavailable profiles as explicit `not_run` gaps.
