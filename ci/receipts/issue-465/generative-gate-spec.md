# Generative Gate: Spec Creation Receipt

**Issue:** #465 - CPU Path Followup
**Gate:** generative:gate:spec
**Status:** ✅ pass
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-15T18:35:00Z
**Flow:** generative

## Summary

Successfully parsed Issue #465 and created structured feature specification with 12 atomic acceptance criteria for post-merge MVP polish. Specification covers documentation updates, baseline establishment, CI enforcement, and release preparation.

## Validation Results

### Issue Analysis
- ✅ Issue fetched successfully from GitHub API
- ✅ Issue content parsed and categorized (post-merge cleanup/polish)
- ✅ Technical context identified (CPU inference, receipt verification, baselines)
- ✅ Dependencies mapped (PR #435, test models, xtask commands)

### Specification Quality
- ✅ User story follows "As a... I want... So that..." pattern
- ✅ 12 atomic acceptance criteria (AC1-AC12) with clear observability
- ✅ ACs map to testable outcomes (copy-paste quickstart, receipt verification, gate enforcement)
- ✅ Technical implementation notes comprehensive (affected crates, pipeline stages, testing strategy)
- ✅ BitNet.rs-specific considerations included (feature flags, deterministic inference, receipt schema)

### Acceptance Criteria Breakdown
1. **AC1-AC2**: Documentation - README quickstart and receipts block
2. **AC3-AC4**: Baselines - Pinned CPU receipt with verification
3. **AC5-AC6**: CI/CD - Branch protection enforcement with smoke test
4. **AC7-AC8**: Dependencies - PR #435 merge and issue closure
5. **AC9-AC10**: Documentation standardization - Feature flags and receipt-driven claims
6. **AC11-AC12**: Release preparation - Pre-tag verification and MVP tag

### Technical Scope
- **Affected Areas**: Documentation, CI/CD, baselines, testing workflows
- **Pipeline Impact**: Documentation updates, baseline establishment, CI enforcement, QA
- **Feature Flags**: CPU-only operations with `--no-default-features --features cpu`
- **Determinism**: Strict mode with `BITNET_STRICT_MODE=1 BITNET_DETERMINISTIC=1 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`

### BitNet.rs Alignment
- ✅ Feature flag requirements specified (`--no-default-features --features cpu`)
- ✅ Receipt verification workflow documented (xtask benchmark + verify-receipt)
- ✅ Baseline requirements include schema v1.0.0 with `compute_path: "real"`
- ✅ Pre-release verification checklist includes clippy, tests, deterministic benchmark
- ✅ Documentation standardization removes legacy claims, adds receipt evidence
- ✅ Release checklist references branch protection and CI gate enforcement

## Files Created

1. **Feature Specification**: `/home/steven/code/Rust/BitNet-rs/docs/explanation/issue-465-spec.md`
   - User story with clear stakeholder value
   - 12 atomic acceptance criteria
   - Comprehensive technical implementation notes
   - Testing strategy with TDD patterns
   - Release checklist for v0.1.0-mvp

## GitHub Integration

- ✅ Issue #465 commented with feature spec summary
- ✅ Labels added: `flow:generative`, `state:in-progress`
- ✅ Ledger sections initialized (Gates, Hoplog, Decision)
- ✅ Routing specified: NEXT → spec-analyzer

## Quality Metrics

- **AC Count**: 12 (balanced scope for MVP polish)
- **AC Atomicity**: ✅ Each AC represents single testable outcome
- **AC Observability**: ✅ All ACs have clear pass/fail criteria
- **Technical Depth**: ✅ Comprehensive implementation notes with commands
- **BitNet.rs Alignment**: ✅ Feature flags, receipt verification, deterministic inference

## Routing Decision

**Next Agent:** spec-analyzer

**Rationale:** Feature specification complete with atomic ACs and comprehensive technical notes. Ready for requirements validation, dependency analysis, and implementation feasibility assessment before proceeding to implementation phase.

**Evidence:**
- 12 atomic acceptance criteria with clear testability
- Technical scope mapped to existing infrastructure (xtask, receipts, baselines)
- Dependencies identified (PR #435, test models, branch protection rules)
- Release checklist provides clear completion criteria
