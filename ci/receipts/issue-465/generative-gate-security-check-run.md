## Output

### Title
✅ Security Validation Passed

### Summary
```
cargo audit: 0 vulnerabilities (727 crates scanned)
clippy: clean (1 test-only unsafe block, properly documented)
input handling: secure (no injection risks)
secrets: 0 hardcoded credentials
neural network security: N/A (documentation-only changes)
```

### Details

**Dependency Security:**
- Tool: cargo-audit v0.21.2
- Advisories Checked: 822
- Dependencies Scanned: 727
- Vulnerabilities Found: **0**
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Memory Safety:**
- New Unsafe Blocks: 1 (test-only, properly documented)
- Unsafe Justification: Test environment configuration (std::env::set_var)
- Pre-existing Issues: clippy::unwrap_used in build scripts (not introduced by Issue #465)
- Status: ✅ PASS WITH NOTES

**Input Handling:**
- JSON Parsing: serde_json with proper error handling
- File I/O: Workspace-relative paths with validation
- Command Execution: Static arguments, no injection vectors
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Secrets Scanning:**
- Hardcoded Secrets: 0
- Patterns Scanned: password, secret, api_key, token, private_key, credential
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Risk Assessment:**
- Overall Risk: LOW
- Production Code Changes: 0
- Test Code Changes: 5 files
- Security-Critical Paths: None
- Deployment Impact: None

**Recommendations:**
- Pre-existing clippy warnings in build scripts should be addressed separately
- Consider adding cargo audit to CI pipeline
- Test-only unsafe block acceptable for determinism

**Next Gate:** benchmark-runner
