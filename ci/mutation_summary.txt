BitNet.rs Mutation Testing Summary - Critical Gaps Detected (T3.6 Update)

OVERALL SCORE: 42.9% (FAILED - Target ≥80%)

TOP 10 CRITICAL SURVIVORS (541 mutants analyzed):

1. I2SQuantizer::dequantize_neon - 4 survivors
   Impact: ARM optimization path returning wrong values (Ok(vec![]), Ok(vec![1.0]))

2. TL2Quantizer::dequantize_avx2/avx512 - 4 survivors
   Impact: Advanced vectorization paths not validated for correctness

3. CPUQuantizer::dequantize_i2s - 4 survivors
   Impact: Core I2S dequantization arithmetic and bit manipulation vulnerable

4. DeviceAwareQuantizer::validate_gpu_cpu_parity - 3 survivors
   Impact: GPU/CPU consistency checks bypassed (< to ==, < to > mutations)

5. AccuracyReport::calculate_std - 3 survivors
   Impact: Statistical accuracy validation logic vulnerable to arithmetic changes

6. TL1Quantizer::dequantize_neon - 3 survivors
   Impact: NEON-optimized table lookup returning incorrect values

7. calculate_snr/calculate_mse utility functions - 6 survivors
   Impact: Signal-to-noise ratio and error calculations not properly validated

8. VectorizedLookupTable::quantize/dequantize - 3 survivors
   Impact: Core table lookup logic vulnerable to arithmetic mutations

9. CPUQuantizer::quantize_i2s bit shifts - 2 survivors
   Impact: Bit manipulation operations (<< to >>) not properly tested

10. Return value substitutions across quantizers - 31% of all survivors
    Impact: Tests validate execution success but not output correctness

MUTATION PATTERN ANALYSIS:
- Return Value Substitution: 31% (tests only check success, not correctness)
- Arithmetic Operator Changes: 28% (division→multiplication, addition→subtraction)
- Comparison Operator Changes: 22% (boundary conditions: <, >=, ==, != gaps)
- Bit Manipulation Changes: 19% (critical for quantization accuracy)

RECOMMENDATION:
ROUTE to test-hardener for comprehensive quantization test hardening.
Priority areas: I2S/TL1/TL2 round-trip accuracy, property-based testing, GPU/CPU parity validation.
Estimated timeline: 2-3 days to reach ≥80% mutation score.
