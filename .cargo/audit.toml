    # RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate is no longer maintained
    #
    # Status: Accepted Risk
    # Rationale: The paste crate is a transitive dependency through tokenizers 0.22.1
    #           which is the latest version. The paste crate is used only as a
    #           procedural macro for compile-time token pasting and does not affect
    #           runtime security in BitNet.rs neural network inference operations.
    #
    # Dependencies: tokenizers 0.22.1 -> paste 1.0.15 (proc-macro)
    # Impact: Compile-time only, no runtime security implications
    # Mitigation: Will be resolved when HuggingFace tokenizers updates to a maintained alternative
    # Review Date: 2024-09-25
    # Re-evaluate: 2025-03-01
