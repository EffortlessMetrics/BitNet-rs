    # RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate is no longer maintained
    #
    # Status: Accepted Risk
    # Rationale: The paste crate is a transitive dependency through tokenizers 0.22.1
    #           which is the latest version. The paste crate is used only as a
    #           procedural macro for compile-time token pasting and does not affect
    #           runtime security in bitnet-rs neural network inference operations.
    #
    # Dependencies: tokenizers 0.22.1 -> paste 1.0.15 (proc-macro)
    # Impact: Compile-time only, no runtime security implications
    # Mitigation: Will be resolved when HuggingFace tokenizers updates to a maintained alternative
    # Review Date: 2024-09-25
    # Re-evaluate: 2025-03-01

    # RUSTSEC-2025-0140: gix-date parse overflow
    #
    # Status: Accepted Risk — Cannot Upgrade
    # Rationale: gix-date is a transitive dependency of gix@0.71.0, which is pinned
    #           by vergen-gix@1.0.9 (build-time dependency). The vulnerability involves
    #           integer overflow in date parsing during git history traversal — used
    #           only at build time for embedding version metadata.
    #
    # Dependencies: bitnet-server -> vergen-gix -> gix -> gix-date (build-time only)
    # Impact: Build-time only; not exposed in inference runtime
    # Mitigation: Will be resolved when vergen-gix updates to gix >= 0.72
    # Re-evaluate: 2025-06-01

    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack on RSA (rsa crate)
    #
    # Status: Accepted Risk — No Fix Available
    # Rationale: The rsa crate vulnerability (timing side-channel in RSA decryption)
    #           has no upstream fix. It is a dependency of jsonwebtoken@10.2.0 used
    #           in bitnet-server for JWT token verification. bitnet-rs is a local
    #           inference engine; JWT usage is for API authentication, not bulk RSA
    #           decryption operations susceptible to timing attacks.
    #
    # Dependencies: bitnet-server -> jsonwebtoken -> rsa
    # Impact: Low — local-deployment API server; not a high-volume crypto service
    # Mitigation: Monitor for jsonwebtoken upgrade to a maintained RSA crate
    # Re-evaluate: 2025-06-01

    # RUSTSEC-2025-0141: bincode 2.x deserialization issue
    #
    # Status: Accepted Risk
    # Rationale: bincode 2.0.1 is a dependency of bitnet-tests (test-only crate).
    #           The vulnerability only affects runtime if deserializing untrusted data.
    #           bitnet-rs only deserializes trusted test fixtures.
    #
    # Dependencies: bitnet-tests -> bincode (test-only)
    # Impact: Test infrastructure only; not in release builds
    # Mitigation: Update when bincode releases a patch
    # Re-evaluate: 2025-06-01
