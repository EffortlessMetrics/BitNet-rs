fix(sampling): implement comprehensive NaN logit safety in sampling pipeline (#184)

Enhance streaming inference robustness by implementing comprehensive NaN handling
in the sampling system to prevent runtime crashes and ensure reliable token generation.

Key improvements:
- Add NaN sanitization by converting NaN logits to -inf before processing
- Implement safe partial_cmp() with fallback to Ordering::Equal for NaN-safe sorting
- Filter NaN values in top-k and top-p sampling algorithms
- Add comprehensive test coverage for NaN handling scenarios

Performance and reliability impact:
- Minimal overhead on normal sampling paths
- Significant improvement in fault tolerance during streaming inference
- Maintains deterministic behavior with proper fallback logic
- Prevents crashes from model output anomalies

Testing coverage:
- New tests: test_top_k_filter_with_nan, test_top_p_filter_with_nan, test_sample_with_nan_logits
- Full validation of core crates: bitnet-cli, bitnet-inference, bitnet-kernels, bitnet-quantization
- Quality gates: formatting, clippy, security audit, build matrix validation

This change directly enhances the production-ready streaming inference capabilities
introduced in recent PRs by providing robust error handling for numerical edge cases.

Closes #184
