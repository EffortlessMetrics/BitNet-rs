## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Tests Passed | Key Features |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Memory Tracking | 5/5 | Real-time monitoring, thread safety |
| Device-Aware Kernels | 4/4 | CPU/GPU integration, platform selection |
| Performance Tracking | 2/2 | Metrics collection, validation |
| Platform Detection | 1/1 | AVX2/NEON selection with memory tracking |

## Build Matrix Validation ✅
- ✅ CPU features: `--no-default-features --features cpu`
- ✅ MSRV compatibility: Rust 1.89.0
- ✅ Clippy lints: Zero warnings
- ✅ Code formatting: Consistent style

## Known Issues
- Python bindings (bitnet-py) have linker issues due to missing Python dev libraries
- This does not affect core memory tracking functionality
- Python tests excluded from validation (--exclude bitnet-py)

## Final Status: ✅ SUCCESS

PR #143 has been successfully merged and validated. The memory tracking functionality is fully integrated and working correctly across the BitNet.rs codebase.

**Next Steps**: All validation complete - PR integration successful.
